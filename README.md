This project has been initiated during the [Hack4Rail 2025](https://hack4rail.event.sbb.ch/en/), a joint hackathon organised by the railway companies SBB, ÖBB, and DB in partnership with the OpenRail Association.

Currently, many medium to small-sized train stations lack (near) real-time monitoring capabilities. This is due to the absence of on-site personnel and the lack of installed video surveillance systems. As a result:

* Anomalies such as vandalism cannot be detected early, which leads to increased damage and delayed responses.
* Security personnel deployment is not demand-driven, making it difficult to assign security staff based on actual risk levels.
* Unnecessary travel and inefficient use of resources occur due to the lack of situational awareness.
* The overall sense of safety and service quality for passengers is reduced, as potential threats or issues remain unnoticed until after the fact.

## Solution Design

The solution enables early detection of unusual behavior at smaller train stations and ensures that staff are deployed based on actual risk levels—not fixed schedules.


* Near Real-Time Anomaly Detection - The system identifies unusual patterns or behaviors (e.g., unauthorized gatherings on platforms) that may indicate potential safety risks.
  
* Immediate Notification and Response - Security personnel are alerted instantly when anomalies are detected, allowing them to assess and resolve the situation on-site.
* Risk-Based Staff Allocation - Employees are dispatched based on actual threat levels rather than fixed schedules, ensuring efficient use of resources.
* Damage Prevention - Early detection helps minimize the impact of incidents such as vandalism, reducing repair costs and service disruptions.
* Operational Efficiency - By avoiding unnecessary travel and idle time, the system improves staff productivity and response times.
* Enhanced Passenger Experience - A safer and more responsive station environment increases the perceived quality of service for travelers.
